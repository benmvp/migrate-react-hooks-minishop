# The End

Congratulations! üèÜ

You've reached the end of the **Migrating to React Hooks** minishop, learning about `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, custom hooks, and so much more! You now have the tools to migrate existing component-based apps over to hooks and/or start building new React apps using hooks.

Hopefully, you'll get to apply this learning right away at your job or in a side project. But if not, I suggest you **come back to this minishop in a week or two** and review the content. Your brain likes to garbage collect unused knowledge and we want this to stick around! The content is all open-source.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Minishop Feedback

Feedback is a gift. üéÅ Now that you're done with the minishop, I would greatly appreciate your overall feedback on the minishop to help make it even better for the next learners. **[Share your minishop feedback](https://bit.ly/to-hooks-ms-feedback)**.
